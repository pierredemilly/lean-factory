Basic Static Website
====================
by Pierre de Milly - http://lanuagerie.com

My basic static website I use for many projects these days.
Feel free to use it if you have the same workflow!

Base
----
Basic general elements
  * markup based on HTML5 Boilerplate
  * favicon and Apple touch icon

Sass
----
This theme uses Sass and compiles everything into a style.css.

Sass imports include:
  * normalize.css
  * useful mixins from Compass
  * color and font variables files
  * a 960px 12cols grid system

Javascript &amp; Coffeescript
-----------------------------
This theme uses Coffeescript for the script file, compiled into a script.js file.

jQuery v1.10.2 is imported from the Google CDN with a local fallback.

Mondernizr v2.5.3 and Respond.js v1.1.0 are included as javascript files.
